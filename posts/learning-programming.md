In order to become a programmer one has to learn **computer science fundamentals** first, this includes variables, memory, cpu, algorithm. After having understanding of the basic vocabulary, the student, need to tackle **algorithms and data structures** and work on some classical problems like array sorting, trees and graphs, linked lists, all while using **pseudocode**.

Having an understanding of algorithms and data structures leads naturaly to writing code. A new student should start using a simple dynamically typed language such as **python**, because of the natural transition from pseudocode to computer code.

After learning python, I think every programmer should learn other low level languages such as C, and Object Oriented language such as Java, this is to ensure that you have a good exposition to different programming paradigms.
